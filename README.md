### Who We're Looking For

The technical Product Manager will inform the development of software products and features as well as lead projects that provide a world-class experience for Moody's Analytics machine learning and artificial intellegence products. 	

You didn’t choose a career in technology because you want to maintain the status quo—you chose it because you’re an innovator. When people around you are content to merely point out problems, you don’t stop until you find solutions better than the ones they hope for. And you won’t settle for using your creativity to do anything less than change the world. Moody's is where your talents and passions meet. We’re a team of collaborators who challenge each other, push each other, and encourage each other to succeed. 

At Moody's, we're excited to be on the leading edge of the financial technology space. We’re pushing the boundaries of what the industry can accomplish as we continue to innovate and use artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve an increasingly high degree of mind-numbingly complex and high-value problems. 

The Moody's Analytics Product Team is looking for a freakishly talented and insanely passionate product manager who wants to lead toward the future by supporting those on the front lines of industry innovaction. The technical Product Manager will inform the development of software products and features as well as lead projects that provide a world-class interactive experience for our clients.
